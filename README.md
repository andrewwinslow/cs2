# Computer Science 2 Course Assignments
Source code given to students for assignments in a second C++ programming course taught by Andrew Winslow at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (CSCI/CMPE 2380 in the UTRGV course catalog). 

There are also assignment instructions (provided as pdf files) that I don't store here, but the instructions for all assignments are largely the same:
1. Download the files.
2. Create the missing source file to match the provided header file (e.g., create pokemon.cpp for provided pokemon.h).
3. Implement the functions/classes/methods described in the header file so that the created and provided files compile into a program that runs to completion (prints "Assignment complete.").

# Technical details
The code adheres to the C++11 spec.
Because these assignments determine a portion of student grades, solutions aren't included.
When the course is running, it can be seen at [http://andrewwinslow.com/2380/](http://http://andrewwinslow.com/2380/).

# Mapping of topics to assignments 
1. Classes: hwPKM1
2. Pointers & Memory: hwART
3. Array-Based Data Structures: hwHIST1
4. Strings, File IO: hwPKM2
5. Dynamic-Array-Based Data Structures: hwLFG1
6. Linked-List-Based Data Structures: hwLFG2, hwHIST2
7. Recursion: hwPW
8. Searching & Sorting: hwAC1, hwSORT
9. C++ STL: hwLOG
10. Tree-Based Data Structures: hwAC2, hwAC3 

# Considerations
The format and design of these assignments emphasizes several ideas:
* The relevance of introductory data structures and algorithms to a variety of domains (the assignments are based around problems related to games, graphics, security, and AI).
* The use of thorough testing to ensure code correctness (assignments are checked against a provided set of unit tests).
* Code modularity and reuse (several assignments come in cumulative thematic groups, encouraging students to write code that can be used later)
* The role of efficiency in programming (several assignments include performance tests that can only be passed if the correct data structure is implemented).

Many of the assignments are organized into thematic groups based on an application domain:
* hwPKM1, hwPKM2: Pokemon game.
* hwHIST1, hwHIST2: Browser history.
* hwLFG1, hwLFG2: Team matchmaking in a role-based game.
* hwPW: Brute-force password cracking.
* hwAC1, hwAC2, hwAC3: The autocomplete feature found in many UIs.
