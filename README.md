# Computer Science 2 Course Assignments
Source code given to students for assignments in a second C++ programming course taught by Andrew Winslow at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (CSCI/CMPE 2380 in the UTRGV course catalog). 

There are also assignment instructions (provided as pdf files) that I don't store here, but the instructions for all assignments are largely the same:
1. Download the files.
2. Create the missing source file to match the provided header file.
3. Implement the functions/classes/methods described in the header file so that the created and provided files compile into a program that runs to completion (printing "Assignment complete").

The code is C++11.
Because these assignments determine a portion of student grades, solutions aren't included.
When the course is running, it can be seen at [http://andrewwinslow.com/2380/](http://http://andrewwinslow.com/2380/).

The mapping of the assignments to topics is as follows:
1. Classes:
* hwPKM1
2. Pointers & Memory:
* hwART
3. Array-Based Data Structures:
* hwHIST1
4. Strings, File IO: 
* hwPKM2
5. Dynamic-Array-Based Data Structures:
* hwLFG1
6. Linked-List-Based Data Structures:
* hwLFG2
* hwHIST2
7. Recursion:
* hwPW
8. Searching & Sorting:
* hwAC1
* hwSORT
9. C++ STL:
* hwLOG
10. Tree-Based Data Structures:
* hwAC2
* hwAC3 

The format and design of these assignments emphasizes several ideas:
* The relevance of introductory data structures and algorithms to a variety of common problems.
* The use of thorough testing to ensure code correctness.
* Code modularity and reuse.
* The role of efficiency in programming.

Many of the assignments are organized into thematic groups based on an application domain:
* hwPKM1, hwPKM2: Pokemon games.
* hwHIST1, hwHIST2: Browser history.
* hwLFG1, hwLFG2: Team matchmaking in a role-based game.
* hwPW: Brute-force password cracking.
* hwAC1, hwAC2, hwAC3: The autocomplete feature found in many UIs.
