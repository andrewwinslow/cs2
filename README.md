# Computer Science 2 Course Assignments
Source code given to students for assignments in a Computer Science 2 course. In particular, the version of a second C++ programming course taught by Andrew Winslow at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (CSCI/CMPE 2380 in the UTRGV course catalog). 
Because these assignments determine a portion of student grades, solutions aren't posted. 
When the course is running, it can be seen at [http://andrewwinslow.com/2380/](http://http://andrewwinslow.com/2380/).
The code is C++11.
